# Brief Introduction

:::{.callout-important}
 **TLDR;**

Create a new Quarto file (.qmd-file) in RStudio and save it within the main directory (where the .Rproj-file is). Then just add the name of the .qmd-file to the \_quarto.yml file (also open it within RStudio). Like this:

``` r

website:
  title: "Special-Rcology"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: about.qmd
        text: The Idea
      - href: authoring.qmd
        text: Authoring
      - href: *YOUR CONTENT.qmd*
        text: *YOUR NAME FOR CONTENT*
        
```

## What is Markdown?

A markup/markdown file is a text file with embedded commands.

These commands can be simple text formatting characters or complete *R scripts*. A *rmd*-file ("R-Markdown") is a mixture of R commands, normal text and formatting code.
