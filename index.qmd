# Setup

You can easily contribute via github by following these steps:

-   "Low key contribution": Just leave a comment on the article you want to enhance. This is especially wanted for general feedback (structure, content etc.)!

-   "I want to add notes myself!"

No problem! It's very easy, really. To get started, watch this [video](https://youtu.be/CML6vfKjQss&t=1m45s) for 2 minutes and you're good to go!

Here's a transcript of what to do: 1. Create a github account [here](https://github.com/login)! 2. Go to the project's website [repository](https://github.com/soekni/Special-Rcology.github.io). 3. Fork it by clicking the button on the top right! 4. After linking the forked repo to your account, clone/download the files at your desired destination using:

```{git}
git clone 
```

5.  Now you're good to go! Change/Add files/notes using Quarto. Check out [this]() article for authoring content or [this]() for learning the basics of markdown!
