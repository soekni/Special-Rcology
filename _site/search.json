    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nTLDR;\nCreate a new Quarto file (.qmd-file) in RStudio and save it within the main directory (where the .Rproj-file is). Then just add the name of the .qmd-file to the _quarto.yml file (also open it within RStudio). Like this:\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Special-Rcology\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: about.qmd\n        text: The Idea\n      - href: authoring.qmd\n        text: Authoring\n      - href: *YOUR CONTENT.qmd*\n        text: *YOUR NAME FOR CONTENT*\n        \n\n\n\n\nA markup/markdown file is a text file with embedded commands.\nThese commands can be simple text formatting characters or complete R scripts.
