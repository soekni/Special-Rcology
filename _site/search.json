You fail, you drink.\nHow about a loop in R?\n\n\n\nFirst, clarify the rules and conditions:\n\nwe assume to have 4 virtual players\neach of them starts sober and therefore with the same probability of rescuing their chicken from Louie, \\(p=1\\)\nnow say, each player got a random probability to not react in time, \\(p*\\), which ranges in between 0-0.25\nwith each failure - and therefore: shot - you’re reaction time drops. But we’re no science quacks, so this is the appropriate formula:\n\n\n\\(\\text{Blood Alcohol Concentration BAC}=\\frac{A*5.14}{W*r}​−0.015*T\\)\n\nWhere:\n\nA = Total alcohol consumed in grams (one schnaps ~ 6.3g pure alcohol)\nW = Body weight in pounds (simplify it to be W=150pounds)\nr = Alcohol distribution ratio (0.68 for men, 0.55 for women; for now, lets assume it to be equal at 0.6 for both sex)\nT = Time since drinking began (in hours; one game is around 15 minutes, so T=0.25)\nThe factor 0.015 represents the average rate of alcohol elimination from the body per hour.\n\nSo, in total this means: Assumed each player gets to react once per minute, in total 15 “skill checks” are required per player per game. We still need to assign the punishment for our drunkards. Don’t drink and fly! That’s not an easy decision, so lets just have a look on our plotted BAC-function:\n\nx &lt;- c(1:15)\nt &lt;- c(1:15)\ny &lt;- x*6.3*5.14/(150*0.6)-0.015*t\ndf &lt;- data.frame(x=x, t=t, y=y) #Create a dataframe\n\n#Plot it\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nplot &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y, t=t)) +\ngeom_line() +\nlabs(title=\"BAC Over Time for Different Number of Drinks\",\nx=\"Number of Drinks (x)\",\ny=\"Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)\",\ncolor=\"Time (hours)\") +\ntheme_minimal()\nplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, assuming you’d be a complete moron and fail each round, there’s permanent death awaiting you at the end of the game.  After 6-8 shots you should no longer be able to play this game. So, given that prior knowledge, lets adjust our research question: \n“Which of the players are still alive after one game?”  For my part, I’d rather prefer switching to Beerpong, instead..\nTBC",

    "section": "The grid approximation",
    "text": "The grid approximation\nSince Bayesian statistics relies on updating the posterior distribution iteratively by looking at the data set and finding a way to fit it to the prior, the grid approximation remains a good way of showcasing this process. (For mathematically complex models - meaning: more parameters - this approach soon becomes unsuitable, though.)\n\nExample: Earth’s coverage of land and water\nLet’s imagine we want to know how much of the earth’s surface is covered by water. We know the exact answer to be ~ 73%, but the model we’re gonna build doesn’t. So this makes a good example of how models only help when properly trained.\nThe model equation itself is based on Bayes Theorem:\nThe theorem tells us how to update our belief about \\(p\\) after observing the data (here \\(W+L\\)), by combining how well \\(p\\) explains the data (the likelihood) with what we already believed about \\(p\\) (the prior), and then normalizing it by the denominator to make sure it forms a valid probability distribution.\nIn this case, the formula is: \\(Pr(p|W,L)=\\frac{Pr(W,L|p)*Pr(p)}{Pr(W,L)}\\) Looks horrifying? Well, maybe. Let’s break down each term:\n\n\\(Pr(p)\\) = our prior belief of what \\(p\\) might be in reality before we see the data.\n\\(Pr(W,L|p)\\) = likelihood (we observe some data and then calculate how likely that data is under different values of \\(p\\)) Think of it as a vector: You generate a vector of probabilities, where each entry corresponds to a different possible value of \\(p\\), and for each \\(p\\), you calculate the likelihood \\(Pr(W,L∣p)*Pr(p)\\). The maximum value out of that vector represents the most probable value of \\(p\\) that aligns the data best with the prior. In order to standardize it, you need to equate the sum of all values, which is \\(Pr(W,L)\\).\n\\(Pr(p)*Pr(W,L|p)\\) = unstandardized posterior\n\nSo in words, the equation would be:\n\\(Posterior\\ distribution = \\frac{\\text{\"Likelihood for each combination of the data * prior\"} \\times \\text{\"Prior probability\"}}{\\text{\"Sum of Likelihoods over all possible values of p\"}}\\)\n\n\nThe Code aka “Theory in Practice”\nNow, we apply it in R to see what all of this means in practice:\n\n#Defining the grid\np_grid &lt;- seq(from=0,to=1, length.out= 20)\n# on each value of the grid (=x), a posterior probability (=y) will be calculated\n\n# Defining the prior\nprior &lt;- rep (1,20) # just repeat \"p=1\" 20 times to create a uniform distribution\n\n#Compute likelihood at each value in grid\nlikelihood &lt;- dbinom(6,size=9, prob=p_grid)#we had 6 water observations out of a sample = 9; calculate the likelihood for each grid step\n\n# Compute product of likelihood and prior\nunstd.posterior &lt;- likelihood * prior\n\n#standardize the posterior, so it sums to 1\nposterior &lt;- unstd.posterior / sum(unstd.posterior)\n\n# Plot it\nplot(p_grid, posterior, type =\"b\",#equals to plot(x,y, \"use bullets, not line)\nxlab=\"probability of water\", ylab=\"posterior probability\")\nmtext(\"20 points\")#assign a simple heading to the plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying the uniform distribution here means we’re very cautious in our assumption and want the model to adjust the posterior distribution only to the data its about to see.\nTBC…",

But for now, lets just DO IT!\nNon-Bayesian Statistics:\n\nparameter: the variable you want to investigate with your data/want to predict. Think of it like a blueprint for a model. Given specific values, the parameters describe the process of how … through the model equation (and its underlying assumptions like linearity or including error terms etc.)\nMaximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE): Statistical method that aims for finding those values for a given parameter, that makes the observed data (=your dataset) most likely. This method assumes a certain distribution (f.e. a normal distribution).\n\nExample: As you may have seen from the previous meme section, every model is trained on a given data set. This also includes the possibility of the model being unsuitable to predict anything, when the base assumptions are flawed. MLE aims to find the parameter of a model in a way that the probability of the model producing the observed data is maximized. However, the “quality” of this process is linked to the sample size, meaning that …\nBayesian Statistics:\n\nprior:\ndistribution:\n\nuniform: every possible outcome in a distribution has the same likelihood to occur (Example: A classic dice with 6 sides.) In Bayesian models, assigning a uniform prior is another way of saying “I don’t have any reason to believe one outcome is more likely than another, so I’ll treat them all the same.”\n\nposterior: What values for the parameter are probable after seeing the data with the assigned prior?\nquadratic approximation (quap): Simplify complex model equations to fit a quadratic shape on the peak (assumption: gaussian distribution of the peak) of the investigated data.\n\nTrivia: Why is the quap often equivalent to the MLE (given high sample size or uniform prior)? Both focus to approximate the peak of a distribution. Both assume that to be gaussian. A gaussian curve is very similar to a quadratic shape at its peak. When the prior is uniform, no parameter value in the posterior distribution will be favored, resulting in a similar outcome of the approximated peak for the investigated parameter."
