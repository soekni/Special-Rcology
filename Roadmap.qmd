I'll just put my initial ideas for further *Rticles* üòè here:

-   Advanced Basics of $R$ (Loops, Functions, Examples)

-   Basic Statistics in $R$ with examples (t-tests, linear models, examples)

-   Further statistics (GLM, GAM, NLS and when to use them)

-   Statistical theory (MLE, sum of least squares, normal distribution, equations)

-   Baysian Statistics in $R$

-   Literature recommendations/Further readings for each *Rticle*

You can add your ideas down below by commenting.
